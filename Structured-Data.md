Serilog is a kind of serialiser. In many cases it has good default behaviour that suits its purpose, but on occasion it is necessary to instruct Serilog on how to store properties that are attached to a log event.

There are a few unusual terms that Serilog uses to refer to how .NET objects map to its internal (sink-agnostic) property representation. These are explained in more detail below, so you can skip this section if you're planning to read the whole page.

* _Stringification_ is the process of taking a supplied .NET property and invoking its `ToString()` method so that the representation reaching the sinks is a simple string
* _Destructuring_ is the process of taking a complex .NET object and converting it into a structure, which may later be represented as say, a JSON object or XML blob
* _Scalars_ are .NET types that can be represented as atomic values; most value types like `int` fit this description, but so do some reference types like `Uri` and `string`

## Why Control Representation?

There are potentially many ways to record an object to the log. Most types can be nicely represented as strings or simple values, but some make more sense to record as collections, and others as structures with named properties.

The storage representation for a log event property makes a big difference to its size in the log, and the memory and processing overhead involved in getting it there.

With this in mind, letâ€™s take a look at how Serilog is configured to work in the simple cases.

## Default Behaviour

When properties are specified in log events, Serilog does its best to determine the correct representation.

### Simple, Scalar Values

```
var count = 456;
Log.Information("Retrieved {Count} records", count);
```

There's little ambiguity as to how the `Count` property should be stored in this case. Being a simple integer value, Serilog will choose that as its representation.

```
{ "Count": 456 }
```

These examples use JSON, but the same principles apply to other formats as well.

Out of the box, Serilog recognises the following list as basic _scalar_ types, regardless of any other policies applied:

* _Booleans_ - `bool`
* _Numerics_ - `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`
* _Strings_ - `string`, `byte[]`
* _Temporals_ - `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `TimeSpan`
* _Others_ - `Guid`, `Uri`
* _Nullables_ - nullable versions of any of the types above

### Collections

If the object passed as a property is `IEnumerable`, Serilog will treat that property as a collection.

```
var fruit = new[] { "Apple", "Pear", "Orange" };
Log.Information("In my bowl I have {Fruit}", fruit);
```

The equivalent JSON includes an array.

```
{ "Fruit": ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"] }
```

Serilog makes this choice because most enumerable types are of interest for their elements, and represent poorly as structures or strings.

Serilog also recognises `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`, as long as the key type is one of the scalar types listed above.

```
var fruit = new Dictionary<string,int> {{ "Apple", 1}, { "Pear", 5 }};
Log.Information("In my bowl I have {Fruit}", fruit);
```

Formatters that support dictionaries can record the property as such.

```
{ "Fruit": { "Apple": 1, "Pear": 5 }}
```

**`IDictionary<TKey,TValue>`** - objects implementing dictionary interfaces are not serialised as dictionaries. Firstly because it is less efficient in .NET to check for generic interface compatibility, and second because a single object may implement more than one generic dictionary interface, creating an ambiguity.

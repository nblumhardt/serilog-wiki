Serilog 2.0 adds to the performance and reliability of the earlier Serilog releases, while aligning Serilog's packaging with the needs of new .NET targets including .NET Core and Linux. Very minimal breaking changes have been made where necessary - practically all code written against Serilog 1.5 will recompile against Serilog 2.0 without errors.

### Platform support

Serilog 2.0 no longer supports .NET 4.0. Applications targeting .NET 4.0 can continue to use the Serilog 1.5 series of packages or [update to .NET 4.5.2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2015/12/09/support-ending-for-the-net-framework-4-4-5-and-4-5-1/).

### Updating to Serilog 2.0

The core Serilog package is `Serilog`. At the Visual Studio _Package Manager Console_:

```powershell
Update-Package Serilog
```

All projects used in a Serilog 2.0 application should be upgraded and rebuilt. Although source compatibility has been maintained, the old **Serilog.FullNetFx** assembly has been removed, and types in it such as `LogContext` moved into the core `Serilog` package. Failing to upgrade projects can lead to `TypeLoadException` being thrown at runtime.

##### NuGet version requirements

Errors installing the NuGet package, mentioning `Microsoft.CSharp` or failing to find the package entirely, may indicate that the version of `NuGet.exe` is out-of-date. **NuGet version 3.0** or better is required to install the _Serilog_ package.

### Installing 2.0 sink packages

In Serilog 1.5, the core _sinks_, including `Console`, `ColoredConsole`, `File`, `RollingFile` and so-on were part of the `Serilog` packages. These are now separate.

To install the new `Console` sink, use:

```powershell
Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Console -Pre
```

The names of sink packages are consistent so that it's easy to guess the correct name, with very few exceptions:

| Sink name | `WriteTo.*` | Package |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Colored Console | `ColoredConsole` | [Serilog.Sinks.ColoredConsole](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.coloredconsole) |
| Console | `Console` | [Serilog.Sinks.Console](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.console) |
| File | `File` | [Serilog.Sinks.File](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.file) |
| Observable | `Observers` | [Serilog.Sinks.Observable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.observable) |
| Periodic Batching | | [Serilog.Sinks.PeriodicBatching](https://www.nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.periodicbatching) |
| Rolling File | `RollingFile` | [Serilog.Sinks.RollingFile](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.rollingfile) |
| TextWriter | `TextWriter` | [Serilog.Sinks.TextWriter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.observable) |
| Trace | `Trace` | [Serilog.Sinks.Trace](https://www.nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.trace) |

### Installing 2.0 enricher packages

If your application uses any of the built-in enrichers such as machine name or thread, you'll need to install the corresponding package:

```powershell
Install-Package Serilog.Enrichers.Environment -Pre
```

The three packages that were previously included in the core `Serilog` package are:

| Enricher package | `Enrich.*` |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| [Serilog.Enrichers.Environment](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.enrichers.environment) | `MachineName`, `UserName` |
| [Serilog.Enrichers.Process](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.enrichers.process) | `ProcessId` |
| [Serilog.Enrichers.Thread](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.enrichers.thread) | `ThreadId` |

### XML `<appSettings>` support

This has moved to [Serilog.Settings.AppSettings](https://nuget.org/packages/serilog.settings.appsettings):

```powershell
Install-Package Serilog.Settings.AppSettings -Pre
```

### Shutting down or disposing the logger

If your application uses any network-based or asynchronous sinks, Serilog 2.0 requires you to explicitly shut down the logging pipeline so that queued events are properly flushed before the application exits.

It's not strictly necessary to add this code if you only use local file/console logging, but considered best practice to do so anyway.

(This change makes Serilog's behavior consistent across platforms, including .NET Core, where `AppDomain` unloading events are no longer available).

If you use the static `Log` class:

```csharp
Log.CloseAndFlush();
```

Or otherwise, if you use the return value of `CreateLogger()` directly, you will need to call `Dispose()` on it.

This can be done:

 * At the end of `Main()`
 * In the `Application_End()` method of ASP.NET's `Global.asax`

### Implementing `ILogger`

If your application or library implements Serilog's `ILogger`, several methods have been added in Serilog 2.0 that will need to be accounted for.

 * `Write()`, `Verbose()`, `Debug()`, `Information()`, `Warning()`, `Error()` and `Fatal()` now have generic overloads that avoid allocations when logging is disabled; these otherwise behave the same as the existing methods with those names
 * `ForContext(ILogEventEnricher)` has been added
 * `BindMessageTemplate()` and `BindProperty()` have been added; most implementations can ignore these and return `false`

### `LogContext` changes

Some longstanding issues in the `LogContext` feature have been fixed in 2.0. This means that `LogContext.Suspend()` and `LogContext.PermitCrossAppDomainCalls` are no longer necessary in any scenario, and so have been removed. If your code uses these members, just remove the usages and everything should now "just work".

The Serilog Organisation generally uses the following structure for the projects regardless of function (sinks, enrichers etc.)

## Code Structure

Folders 
* `src` - Location of the source files
* `test` - Location of testing resources
* `assets` - Location of shared resources such as `.snk`, package logos.

## Builds

Serilog projects use [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/serilog/serilog) for builds, with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/serilog/serilog) used for cross platform builds.
